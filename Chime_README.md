# **Mercury: An Online Digital Banking Solution**  
This readme file will provide an overview of Mercury.com, a digital banking solution for startups.


## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?

  Mercury
* When was the company incorporated?

  2017 
* Who are the founders of the company?

  Immad Akhund, Jason Zhang, Max Tagher
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  Traditional banks are bogged down by bureaucracy and cannot keep up with the chaotic pace of young startups. Mercury provides an intuitive technology that provides founders with “more control, more time, and more peace of mind.” Their customer experience give startups the static safety of traditional banking with a dynamic flexibility to accommodate start-up speed.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  They have received $163 million from CRV, Coatue Management, Andreessen Horowitz, and others.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  Mercury addresses three primary problems: (1) bureaucracy/speed, (2) high fees, and (3) insured security. Most traditional banks are bogged down by bureaucracy and require long wait times and simply cannot account for the fast pace that startups require to thrive. Second, Mercury charges no monthly fees for its business checking account, and its other fees are lower than those charged by most traditional banks. This is especially important for startups, as startups are usually strapped for cash and cannot afford high fees. Third, unlike many banks that only have $250k insured by the FDIC, Mercury is insured by the FDIC up to $5M. 


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

  Mercury is a digital bank that is specifically designed for startups and early-stage businesses. It works for all US companies, except for businesses that are money-services or involved with adult entertainment, cannabis, or internet gambling.
The U.S. Digital Banking Platform Market size was valued at USD $2.72B Million in 2021 and is projected to reach USD $6.20B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.87% from 2022 to 2030. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  No fees: The Mercury online platform has no monthly fees, no transaction fees, no minimum opening deposit requirement, and no minimum balance requirement. In addition, Mercury offers fee-free access to withdraw cash through the Allpoint network and does not charge for out-of-network ATM use. That said, you may face fees from the ATM provider.Mercury also has no overdraft fees, does not charge to send or receive checks and offers free domestic and international wire transfers (a 1% currency exchange fee applies to transfers not in U.S. dollars).

  Digital tools: With Mercury, you have access to built-in digital tools that allow you to send and receive online payments, track transactions and cash-flow analytics and monitor spending. Mercury offers the ability to create virtual debit cards, as well as manage your debit card — edit spending limits, freeze your card, add it to your mobile wallet — through its app.

  API access: Mercury includes read-write API access with all accounts — in other words, developer access to its banking software — a particularly noteworthy feature for startups and other tech-focused businesses. With this API access, you can customize and automate your Mercury account by designing internal dashboards, making bulk payments, creating transfer rules, reconciling transactions and more. Moreover, Mercury allows you to integrate your account with third-party business tools, such as QuickBooks and Xero.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may 

  want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Mercury is actively using 15 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include SPF, Google Tag Manager, and Global Site Tag. For a complete list, see this website: https://builtwith.com/detailed/mercury.com



## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  Mercury is in the digital banking domain of the fintech industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

  The rise of mobile banking: Mobile banking has become much more popular as people have begun to use their tablets and smartphones to manage their finances. In 2021, 43.5% of Americans used mobile banking as their primary method of account access, up from 15.1% in 2017.
The emergence of neobanks: Neobanks are purely digital banks – they do not have any physical branches. They offer a more streamlined and user-friendly experience than traditional banks and often have lower fees and higher interest rates.
The adoption of new technologies: Digital banks are increasingly adopting new technologies – like AI and blockchain – to improve products and services. For example, AI has recently been utilized to personalize banking recommendations and to detect fraud. Blockchain is used, among other things, to create more secure and streamlined payment systems.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

  Bluevine

  Posh

  SVB (formerly)

  Axos Bank

  Grasshopper

  Brex Cash


  Notably, Mercury’s founder, Akhund, doesn’t see much competition: “strangely, we're in a very uncompetitive space, and that's the weird thing for people to see,” he explained. “You know, SVB was our main competitor.”

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  Mercury made online banking more affordable for startups. It offers a number of banking services at competitive prices, and it’s easy for startups to open accounts and manage finances online. Mercury has increased the quality of the entire online banking industry by raising customer expectations. By offering unique services like the ability to open accounts online in minutes and to manage your finances through a mobile app with a high-quality UI, it has forced other banks to improve their own online offerings. Mercury has catalyzed innovative-tech adoption. It was one of the first banks to offer real-time payments and open banking services. 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? & How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


  Because Mercury is a private company, it does not have to disclose the common metrics that institutions often use to measure its performance. However, if I was able to access Mercury’s metrics, I would focus on Revenue growth, customer acquisition cost, assets under management, loan portfolio growth, customer satisfaction (which Mercury has performed very well in), churn rate, and market share.
  

  Nonetheless, we can assume it’s doing well. As Forbes writes, “according to venture capitalists, Mercury has likely been the biggest winner so far among the fintech digital banks” following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Because its largest competitor in the ‘startup banking space’ failed (for all intents and purposes), Mercury was able to significantly capitalize on its competitor’s failure and accumulate a large influx of new customers over this past year. That said, I believe that the SVB’s failure has made startups question the safety of their money, and Mercury will have to move quickly to reassure the new skepticism present in the market.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  I would highly recommend that they improve their customer service. As of March 13, 2023, Mercury’s customer service relies “primarily on email and lack[s] weekend support availability, and does not accept cash deposits.” This is hugely problematic. Having worked at a start-up myself, I can speak from experience that weekend support is critical. I work 7 days a week at my start-up, and I expect my bank to do so as well, especially when so many other competitors offer 24/7 customer service. This should be changed immediately.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  Customer service is critical to banking. A good UI, ease of use, and seamless customer support are necessary for Mercury to succeed, full stop. With so many other banking options, any notion that Mercury cannot handle the dynamic speed of their small-business customers will only stoke the flame of the already-looming idea that the company cannot be trusted as a financial institution. Consequently, improving customer service by offering 24/7 support will likely not benefit the company, but it will remove (some of) the risk of customers doubting Mercury’s reliability. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  AI will be a key solution to improving customer support. Customer support was recently ranked as one of the top ten most stressful jobs, and companies consistently see employee turnover rates of nearly 45% annually in these positions. AI will enable customer service agents to avoid the mundane tasks and focus on the more interesting elements of the job, such as working through difficult challenges with customers and building personal relationships.
  Quantitative analysis will drive customer service. To clarify, this will not require new technology. Rather, it will require traditional technology applied to a traditional service in a novel way: python, microsoft excel, tableau, etc. A data-driven strategy is essential to gain additional insights and ensure that Mercury’s customer service is superior to other competitors.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  These technologies will improve both sides of the equation. First, they will improve the lives of the employees. AI will remove a great deal of the mundane repetition that comes with being a customer service agent, and data-driven strategies will improve the customer service experience, thereby giving the employee a greater sense that his actions are worthwhile and provide legitimate value. Second, the customers will have 24/7 access to their bank – something already established as critical – and not only will they have access, the customer service will be seamless with these technologies. No more time waiting on hold for customer service agents, and no more searching the websites trying to find the solution yourself. AI will walk you through most “solvable problems” and will immediately pass you through to customer service reps for challenges beyond its domain. This technique will be iterated and improved constantly, as data analysis drives these customer service strategies.
